A list of potential heme-based gasoreceptors were identified based on GO ID terms. Heme-based gasoreceptors = [ Proteins with GO:0020037: heme binding ] AND [ Proteins with GO:0003824: Catalytic activity ]

The list of protein gasoreceptors is shared with the research community before peer reviewed publication to aid in the investigation of gasocrine signaling in human health and diseases.
